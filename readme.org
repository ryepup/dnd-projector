* Overview

  This is a hobby project to use a mini-projector with my eeepc to
  ease DND bookkeepping.

  This will be controlled via an old TV remote, and displayed via a
  web browser.

* web UI

  Uses jquery to fetch the latest IR command, with the HTTP request
  blocking until we get input.

** make jquery plugin for player UI so it is easy to update and extend
** separate selected from the current players turn

   so you could select many people then give one damage, or have a
   per-player timer
** package up the page state such that the recall button can be undo
*** keep a list of game states, have a 'render state' function?
    sounds like work, maybe localStorage?
