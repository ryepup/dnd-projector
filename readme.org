* Overview
This is a hobby project to use a mini-projector with my eeepc to ease
DND bookkeepping.

This will be controlled via an old TV remote, and displayed via
a web browser.
* web UI
Uses jquery to fetch the latest IR command, with the HTTP request
blocking until we get input.
** combat tracker
*** DONE enter to begin
*** DONE list of combatants, up/down to select
*** add a new opponent
*** remove an opponent
*** cycle through a round
*** record damage
*** move player order
** post-combat stats display

* Nicer arduino packaging
The current breadboard wire madness isn't practical, would need to be
cleaned up and made more robust before it'll survive tableside.
* DONE IR input
Most of this is completed in my arduino-experiments repo.
